# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Built with React

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe (noughts and crosses) game built using React. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Download and install from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: This is included with Node.js, so it should be installed automatically.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**.

2. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the local server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Follow the prompts to view the code running in a browser. This will typically open a new browser window with the game running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

### Files

- **App.js**:

  - This file creates the main component of the application. In React, a component is a piece of reusable code that represents a part of a user interface. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application.

- **styles.css**:

  - This file defines the styles for your React app. The first two CSS selectors (`*` and `body`) define the style of large parts of your app while the `.square` selector defines the style of any component where the `className` property is set to `square`. In your code, that would match the button from your `Square` component.

- **index.js**:

  - This file serves as the bridge between the component you created in `App.js` and the web browser.

  ```javascript
  import { StrictMode } from "react";
  import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
  import "./styles.css";

  import App from "./App";
  ```

  - Lines 1-5 bring all the necessary pieces together: React, React’s library to talk to web browsers (React DOM), the styles for your components, and the component you created in `App.js`.
  - The remainder of the file brings all the pieces together and injects the final product into `index.html` in the public folder.

### Final Result Code Compilation

Here is a detailed look at the main parts of the code:

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";

function Square({ value, onSquareClick }) {
  return (
    <button className="square" onClick={onSquareClick}>
      {value}
    </button>
  );
}

function Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) {
  function handleClick(i) {
    if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {
      return;
    }
    const nextSquares = squares.slice();
    if (xIsNext) {
      nextSquares[i] = "X";
    } else {
      nextSquares[i] = "O";
    }
    onPlay(nextSquares);
  }

  const winner = calculateWinner(squares);
  let status;
  if (winner) {
    status = "Winner: " + winner;
  } else {
    status = "Next player: " + (xIsNext ? "X" : "O");
  }

  return (
    <>
      <div className="status">{status}</div>
      <div className="board-row">
        <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(0)} />
        <Square value={squares[1]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(1)} />
        <Square value={squares[2]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(2)} />
      </div>
      <div className="board-row">
        <Square value={squares[3]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(3)} />
        <Square value={squares[4]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(4)} />
        <Square value={squares[5]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(5)} />
      </div>
      <div className="board-row">
        <Square value={squares[6]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(6)} />
        <Square value={squares[7]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(7)} />
        <Square value={squares[8]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(8)} />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default function Game() {
  const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]);
  const [currentMove, setCurrentMove] = useState(0);
  const xIsNext = currentMove % 2 === 0;
  const currentSquares = history[currentMove];

  function handlePlay(nextSquares) {
    const nextHistory = [...history.slice(0, currentMove + 1), nextSquares];
    setHistory(nextHistory);
    setCurrentMove(nextHistory.length - 1);
  }

  function jumpTo(nextMove) {
    setCurrentMove(nextMove);
  }

  const moves = history.map((squares, move) => {
    let description;
    if (move > 0) {
      description = "Go to move #" + move;
    } else {
      description = "Go to game start";
    }
    return (
      <li key={move}>
        <button onClick={() => jumpTo(move)}>{description}</button>
      </li>
    );
  });

  return (
    <div className="game">
      <div className="game-board">
        <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} />
      </div>
      <div className="game-info">
        <ol>{moves}</ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function calculateWinner(squares) {
  const lines = [
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8],
    [0, 3, 6],
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [0, 4, 8],
    [2, 4, 6],
  ];
  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const [a, b, c] = lines[i];
    if (squares[a] && squares[a] === squares[b] && squares[a] === squares[c]) {
      return squares[a];
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

## Future Improvements

Here are some ideas for improving the Tic-Tac-Toe game, listed in order of increasing difficulty:

1. **Current Move Indicator**: For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
2. **Dynamic Board Creation**: Rewrite the `Board` component to use loops to create the squares instead of hardcoding them.
3. **Move Sorting**: Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
4. **Winning Highlight**: When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
5. **Move Location**: Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.

Feel free to contribute to this project by implementing any of these features or coming up with new ideas!

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
